# BusyBus App

> A public transportation app designed to help users better understand bus routes and bus arrival times in their city.

## The Problem
Due to expansion, many new bus routes have been added to the local city transit system. Now, several different routes and buses pass through each bus stop, and riders are looking for a way to understand which bus is arriving next and when it will arrive at the stop.

## The Solution
By providing a clear and organized interface, the BusyBus app allows users to easily navigate the many bus routes coming through each stop. The users see the next arriving buses first and exactly how many minutes they have until each ones comes. The page below is the Stops page, which provides the most important details about each route.
